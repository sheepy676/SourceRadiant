SourceRadiant
=================

The open-source, cross-platform level editor for Source Engine and GoldSrc based games.

SourceRadiant is a fork of NetRadiant-custom ([GtkRadiant](https://icculus.org/gtkradiant/) 1.4&rarr;massive rewrite&rarr;1.5&rarr;[NetRadiant](https://netradiant.gitlab.io/)&rarr;[NetRadiant-custom](https://github.com/Garux/netradiant-custom)&rarr;this)

## THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN AN EARLY ALPHA STATE!<br/>DO NOT OVERWRITE HAMMER-MADE VMFS WITH THIS!<br/>MAKE BACKUPS!

![d1_trainstation_02.vmf](.github/trainstation.png)

## Goals

- Become a viable Source Engine level editor beyond the novelty of making levels outside of Windows
- Stay in step with general editor changes from upstream [NetRadiant-custom](https://github.com/Garux/netradiant-custom)
- Disable any Radiant feature that is unrelated to Source Engine level editing
- Attempt to upstream any editor changes that are related to code cleanup and general usability improvements.

## Features

### Can Do

- Load VMF maps
	- FIXME: Discards Displacements.
	- FIXME: Discards Visgroups.
	- FIXME: Discards some metadata, like `viewsettings` and `mapversion`.
	- FIXME: Discards Cordons.
	- FIXME: Discards Cameras.
	- FIXME: Discards VMF object IDs
- Save VMF maps
	- ~~FIXME: Sometimes solids are saved incorrectly and then the map won't compile.~~
	- FIXME: Needs to have a special case for not merging entity keys that start with "On", which are **always** Source Engine I/O outputs.
- Load VMT materials
	- ~~FIXME: Doesn't prioritize loading the `%tooltexture` VTF before `$basetexture`.~~
- Load VTF textures
- Load files from VPKs, GMAs and GCFs
	- FIXME: Doesn't support "old style" VPK layouts, like from Source SDK 2006.
	- ~~TODO: Support VTMB VPKs. They can already be loaded by sourcepp, but my code assumes that the filenames end with `_dir.vpk`, which the VTMB ones don't.~~
	- ~~TODO: Support Garry's Mod GMAs. They can already be loaded by sourcepp, but my code needs some adjustments for it to work right.~~
- Load MDL models
	- ~~FIXME: Only loads the first MDL surface, so some models are missing chunks.~~
- Compile Maps
- Load FGDs
	- FIXME: Only loads them from gamepacks directory.
	- ~~FIXME: Doesn't load choice/list keyvalues.~~
	- FIXME: Doesn't write default keyvalues to the saved map, like Hammer does.
	- ~~FIXME: Discards Source Entity I/O keys.~~

### Can't Do (yet):

- Displacements
	- Might be a tough challenge to modify Patch support into Displacement support. I was told that [FTEQW](https://github.com/fte-team/fteqw) has code for converting Displacements into Q3-style bezier curves.
- Source Entity I/O
	- Mostly a UI issue. In the short term it will be better to just document the plaintext format of I/O strings, and make sure they don't get merged in the saved VMF.
	- **NOTE**: All Source Entity I/O strings have the following format: `target,inputName,dataString,delayinSeconds,numUses`, so you could enter them manually as entity keys.
- Visgroups
	- May require some restructuring of Radiant internals to achieve. Radiant's "layers" system doesn't seem to be the same.
- Decals
	- Probably should look at [TrenchBroom](https://github.com/TrenchBroom/TrenchBroom/)'s implementation for reference.
- Instances

### To Do:

- Improve WAD handling for GoldSrc gamepacks
	- Allow you to choose which WADs get mounted instead of mounting all the ones it can find
	- Write `wad` keyvalue in the `worldspawn` entity so GoldSrc compile tools can work properly.
- Allow you to pick which texture directories to load (like TrenchBroom)
- Add read/write support of [J.A.C.K.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/496450/JACK/) map files for better GoldSrc developer interop
- Add read-only support of Worldcraft map files for loading legacy GoldSrc maps
- Simple prefab system
	- Support Worldcraft `.ol` prefab libraries
	- Support general prefabs loaded from a folder
- Parse TrenchBroom-specific map keys
	- Convert TrenchBroom map layers into Radiant map layers

## Compiling

```bash
cmake -Bbuild -S.
cmake --build build
```

A fully prepared copy of the editor will be placed under the `install`
directory.
